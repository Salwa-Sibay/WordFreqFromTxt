# WordFreqFromTxt
My final project completed with a friend in which you enter the name of a text file and it will compute the frequencies of certain words.
This was used for finding the supposed author of Federalist paper 63
It uses the frequencies of the words and, by, from, the, etc per 1000 words and the frequency of words per sentence.
